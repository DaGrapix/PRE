# Pose estimation of Inspire-sat 7 - a Low Earh Orbit Satellite - using ML methods

This repository contains the codes written during my research internship about the attitude determination of a Low Earth Orbit satellite, using deep-learning methods on the different sensor measurements (radiation sensors, inertial sensors, magnetometer).

This repository contains 3 notebooks:
- A test exploitation
- A simulation
- A Monte Carlo simulation
