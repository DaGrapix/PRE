# Pose estimation of Inspire-sat 7 using ML methods

Inspire-sat 7, launched on April 15th 2023, is the second satellite of the LATMOS cubesat constellation aimed at monitoring the Earth and it's climate with high spatial and temporal resolutions. Estimating the attitude of the satellite - its orientation with respect to a reference frame - is crucial in order to have accurate measurements of Earth's outgoing radiations.

This repository contains the ressources developped during this internship. It focused on developing and validating ML models by assessing their performance for estimating the satellite's attitude using both on-ground tests and in-house developed simulations.

You'll find 3 notebooks here:
- A ground-test exploitation
- An in-orbit simulation and treatment
- A Monte Carlo simulation based on the simulation results
